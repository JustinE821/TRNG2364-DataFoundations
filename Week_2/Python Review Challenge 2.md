'''
You are building a simple fitness tracking analysis tool.
A CSV file contains daily step counts for a user.
Your program will:

Read data from a file

Let the user choose how many days to analyze

Use NumPy for calculations

Use pandas for data handling

Use matplotlib for visualization

Your Task:
Load the CSV file using pandas.

Ask the user:

"How many days of data would you like to analyze (1–7)?"

Use the user’s input to select the first N days from the dataset.

Use NumPy to calculate:
Average steps
Maximum steps
Minimum steps

Display the results in the terminal.

Plot a bar chart of steps for the selected days.

Add:
